    <h3>Get to Know Me a Little Better</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Jennifer Little. I graduated from Arkansas State University in 2008 with my B.S. in Clinical Laboratory Science. I work at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee as a medical laboratory scientist IV in a molecular infectious disease lab. My team and I worked many long days and nights to validate COVID-19 testing so patients in the Nashville area could start the screening process. Making this my 12th year in the allied health-care field, I am pursing a <em>career change</em> to <strong>online education</strong>, and this course will help me learn to design my own website with learning modules. I now wear a yellow MIZZOU sweatshirt. Yeah! <br/> A little more about me: I have a 16-year-old son Alex, plus two dogs and two cats named Lucy, Peanut, Roller, and Toby. I have used Udacity for an introduction to front-end web development. I have also taken computer science courses where I learned C++ and Python. I am training to run a half-marathon and climb Mt. Rainier (I'm from the Pacific Northwest). Currently, I am getting a crash course in online education or shall I say trial by fire? My son has started the virtual schooling route...</p>
